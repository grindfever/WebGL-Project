## TP 1 Notes

- In exercise 1 we observed how MyDiamond was made and learned how to use the coordinates and vertices to create figures using triangles , we still dont know all about WebGl and hope we can later have a better understanding on how all the methods called work. 

- In exercise 1&2 we had difficulties in doing a one sided figure right away weÂ´ve been creating the figure and if it doesnt show up we invert the vertices because we are working with triangles and by inverting the order we get a counterclockwise order of the vertices if they were clockwise before inverting the order, but other than that we found it was very straightforward to understand.

This is the Diamond that was already implemented:

Then on Ex1 we implemented the rectangular triangle "MyTriangle" and the parallelogram "MyParallelogram" and the Gui to show/hide the figures:

- We observed a few visual glitches in the parallelogram when we called the `display` function before the `setDefaultAppearance` function before we corrected it.
- We also had to augment the width of the controls panel to fit the text of the labels.

On Ex 2 we had a better understanding on how to create the figures so we came up with "MyTriangleSmall" & "MyTriangleBig" easily and also added a Gui to show/hide the figures like in Ex1:
